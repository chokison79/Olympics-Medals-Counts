#Project 1 Team 2
The project looked at the performance of countries in the Olympic Games across time. A full project description is in "Olympic Medals (1896-2014).pdf", with the project report in "Olympic Medals - report.pdf"

Datasets used were: Primary: ‘Olympic Sports and Medals 1896 – 2014’: https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games
Secondary: Host cities and countries, https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm/olympic-games-hosts
Secondary: Country names and IOC codes

We analysed three questions, in summary:

1. Which are the top performing countries in the Games
2. Who performs best at new events
3. What is the impact of being a Host country

The code for the project can be found in the "Notebooks" folder, with contributions as follows:

1. Data Exploration.ipynb - Jesse (data and visualisation)
2. Q1.ipynb - Belinda and Choki (data and visualisation), Tom (statistical analysis)
3. Q2 - visualisation.ipynb - Maxwell (data and visualisation), Tom (statistical analysis)
4. Q3.ipynb - Tom (Dataframe and visualisation), Amjad (Statistical analysis)

Our conclusions on the three questions posed are:

1. The top five countries represented in each Games have changed many times, but we found very little evidence of trends in time
2. Many countries win medals for new events, but the USA have by far the best performance
3. Hosting the Games does have a positive impact on medal performance in the year of hosting
